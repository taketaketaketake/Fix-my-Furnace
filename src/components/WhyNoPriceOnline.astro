      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Every furnace problem is unique. What looks like a simple fix might reveal deeper issues once diagnosed. Or vice versa — what sounds scary might be a quick $150 part replacement.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        <strong>That's why we start with a $125 professional diagnosis.</strong> Our licensed technician will examine your system, identify the exact problem, and give you transparent pricing options before any work begins. No surprises, no pressure.
